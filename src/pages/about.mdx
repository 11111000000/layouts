# About

This site is meant to be a go-to resource for examples of modern page layout styles for use in React.
Each example is self-contained, so that you can copy and paste the code into your own application's components and supply props as needed.

## Contributing

If you have an idea for a new layout or would like to improve one of the existing examples, <br /> please **[open a PR][github]**.
