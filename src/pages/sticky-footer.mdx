# Sticky Footer

This layout ensures the footer never renders in the middle of the viewport if the content area is not tall enough.
Based on [Solved by Flexbox](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/).

*Note: the height is altered in the preview to better fit in the screen*

<Editor component={StickyFooter} />
